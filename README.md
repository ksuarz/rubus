RUBUS
#####
This repository contains code for a Rutgers service that lets you send text messages for bus times.

You can text the number 848-999-3001 with "RUBUS <stopname>" to retrieve bus times for a stop. The stopname works with most abbrevations for a stop name. Example: "rsc" for Rutgers Student Center, or "dcc" for Douglass Campus Center.
